# Movie-Statistics-Project
In this project, i will practice summary statistics from real data. I will:

* Make choices about which summary statistics are appropriate based on the situation
* Answer free-response questions and compare your answers to a sample solution available after you submit your answer
* Answer toggle questions that can be clicked on to toggle an explanation or solution
